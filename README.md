# Prodex Intras Project
## Description of the Project
1. The project uses YOLO to detect the person and adjust the spotlight angle accordingly.
2. The main file is the src/intras/main.py file
### Progress Checkpoints:
- [x] Speaker Detection
- [x] Simulate Laser dot with simple gradient-descent-like algorithm
- [x] Implement PID in laser dot
- [x] Calibrate for distance based on height of speaker's detected model
- [x] To be Decided: Make detected dot follow the speaker
- [x] Simulate spotlight using golden circle
- [x] Increase Modularity of code
