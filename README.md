# Prodex Tasks and Projects
## 1. Intra-Prodex Project
1. The project uses YOLO to detect the person and adjust the spotlight angle accordingly.
2. The main file is the src/intras/main.py file
### Progress Checkpoints:
- [x] Speaker Detection
- [x] Simulate Laser dot with simple gradient-descent-like algorithm
- [ ] Implement PID in laser dot
- [ ] Calibrate for distance based on height of speaker's detected model
- [ ] To be Decided: Make detected dot follow the speaker
- [ ] Simulate spotlight using golden circle
- [ ] Increase Modularity of code
